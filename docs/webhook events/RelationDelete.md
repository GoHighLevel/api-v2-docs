# Relation Delete

## Overview

This webhook response is triggered when an existing relation between objects is deleted. 

For example, in a business management system, a company may want to remove an relation between a custom object record and a contact. In this case:
- The **first object** (custom object record) could represent an entity such as a project or a transaction.
- The **second object** (contact) would represent a person associated with the custom object.


## Schema

The webhook response follows the JSON schema below:

```json json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string"
    },

    "firstRecordId": {
